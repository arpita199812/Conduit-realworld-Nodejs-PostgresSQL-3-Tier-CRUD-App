# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> **React / Vite + SWC / Express.js / Sequelize / PostgreSQL codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://realworld.io/) spec and API.**

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **React / Vite + SWC / Express.js / Sequelize / PostgreSQL** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

> For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

### Installation

To install the project on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arpita199812/conduit-realworld-example-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd conduit-realworld-example-app
   ```

3. Install project dependencies by running the command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project
2. Add the required environment variables as specified in the [`.env.example`](backend/.env.example) file
3. (Optional) update the Sequelize configuration parameters in the [`config.js`](backend/config/config.js) file
4. If you are **not** using PostgreSQL, you may also have to install the driver for your database:

   <details>
   <summary>Use one of the following commands to install:</summary><br/>

   > Note: `-w backend` option is used to install it in the backend [`package.json`](backend/package.json).

   ```bash
   npm install -w backend pg pg-hstore  # Postgres (already installed)
   npm install -w backend mysql2
   npm install -w backend mariadb
   npm install -w backend sqlite3
   npm install -w backend tedious       # Microsoft SQL Server
   npm install -w backend oracledb      # Oracle Database
   ```

   > :information_source: Visit [Sequelize - Installing](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/getting-started/#installing) for more infomation.
   >
   > npm install --save-dev sequelize-cli
   > npx sequelize â€“version

   ***

   </details>

5. Create database specified by configuration by executing

   > :warning: Please, make sure you have already created a superuser for your database.

   ```bash
   npx sequelize db:create --config backend/config/config.js 
   ```

   > :information_source: The command `npm run sqlz` is an alias for `npx -w backend sequelize-cli`.  
   > Execute `npm run sqlz -- --help` to see more of `sequelize-cli` commands availables.

6. Optionally you can run the following command to populate your database with some dummy data:

   ```bash
   npm run sqlz -- db:seed:all
   ```

### Usage
